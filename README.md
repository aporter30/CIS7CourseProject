 * PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION: 
 * 1. Course Project Part 2 - Case 1: Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel
 *    This Program finds the possible trips the salesman can take, the two shortest paths, and the cost of those paths.
 *    This is done through the use of the branch and bound method which explores the solution space by dividing it into smaller
 *    subproblems and eliminating branches that are guaranteed to contain suboptimal solutions. A multitude of Discrete Structure
 *    concepts are exibited, especially through the use of the adjacency matrix and looping through each permutation to find the
 *    shortest trip(s).
 * 
 * INSTRUCTIONS
 * 1. Since the problem provides all of the necessary information, all you have to do is run the code.
 * 
 * OBJECTIVES
 * 1. If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, 
 *    determine the variations of the trip to the noted cities that he must 
 *    take to market the solar products. COMPLETED
 * 
 * 2. Determine shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing 
 *    specialist. COMPLETED
 * 
 * 3. Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, 
 *    low-cost and shortest paths, including matrices, adjacencies. COMPLETED
 * 
 * 4. Provide documentation that explains solution and programming approaches. COMPLETE
